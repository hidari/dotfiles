# security-blue-red-team

Product-agnostic Red Team / Blue Team security testing automation for Claude Code.

This plugin runs **layered security tests** (Layer 1 static → Layer 2 passive → Layer 3 active → Layer 4 high-risk static) against any project that provides a `<project>/.claude/security-profile.yml`. It is designed for solo / small-team operations where hiring a dedicated security specialist or running an external pentest is not economically viable, but doing nothing is also not acceptable.

## What it provides

- **Two subagents** (Opus): `red-team-agent` (attacker view) and `blue-team-agent` (defender view)
- **Two skills**: `security-red-team`, `security-blue-team`
- **Two slash commands**: `/security-redteam`, `/security-blueteam`
- **Schemas**: `security-profile.schema.yml` (input contract) and `findings.schema.json` (output contract)

## Two-layer architecture

This plugin is the **Universal layer**. Project-specific knowledge (attack surfaces, tech stack, secrets patterns) is injected via:

1. `<project>/.claude/security-profile.yml` — declarative configuration
2. An optional **wrap skill** in the project (e.g. `<project>/.claude/skills/<product>-security-review/`) that calls this plugin and adds product-specific orchestration (issue filing, Discord notifications, etc.)

## Safety design

The plugin treats security testing as a **safety-critical** activity:

- `environment.kind: production` in the profile is **rejected at subagent startup**. No tests are run.
- HTTP requests are restricted to URLs in `environment.allow_targets`. Anything else is rejected.
- Per-test request budget: max 20 requests, min 100ms interval, max 5 concurrent, 10s timeout.
- Destructive operations (DELETE / overwriting PUT) are **planned but not executed**.
- Direct attacks on third-party services (auth / payments / CDN / cloud metadata APIs) are **forbidden**; their defenses are verified via static analysis (Layer 4).

## How it is invoked

```text
/security-redteam [--layer=1|2|3|4|all] [--target=local|staging]
/security-blueteam [--mode=a|b] [--report=<path>]
```

Or via natural language: "Red Team を走らせて", "Blue Team でこのレポートに対する改善計画を立てて", etc.

## Outputs

- `<output_dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/red-team.md` — human-readable report
- `<output_dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/findings.json` — machine-readable (schema in `schemas/findings.schema.json`)
- `<output_dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/blue-team.md` — Blue Team mode A / B output

`<output_dir>` defaults to `docs/security-reviews/` (project root relative) and is overridable per invocation.

## Boundary

This plugin **does not**:

- File issues (delegate to a wrap skill / `in-repo-issue` / `gh issue`)
- Create PRs or modify code (delegate to a wrap skill / the user)
- Call other skills (`pre-merge-quality-gate`, `chrome-devtools-debugger`, `playwright-test`, etc.)
- Run against production (refused at startup)

The boundary is enforced both in skill `description` and in subagent system prompts.

## Profile contract

A minimal valid profile:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
product:
  name: my-app
  repo: org/my-app
environment:
  kind: local
  allow_targets: []
stack:
  backend: nodejs
endpoints:
  auth_required: []
  public: []
```

See `schemas/security-profile.template.yml` for a fully annotated template and `schemas/security-profile.schema.yml` for the JSON Schema.

## Status

v0.1.0 — Phase 1 (Red Team Layer 1-4 + machine-readable findings). Blue Team and cron integration in subsequent phases.
